## Welcome to **Google Test**, Google's C++ test framework!

This repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock
projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and
release them together.

Please subscribe to the mailing list at googletestframework@googlegroups.com for
questions, discussions, and development.

### Getting started:

The information for **Google Test** is available in the
[Google Test Primer](googletest/docs/primer.md) documentation.

**Google Mock** is an extension to Google Test for writing and using C++ mock
classes. See the separate [Google Mock documentation](googlemock/README.md).

More detailed documentation for googletest is in its interior
[googletest/README.md](googletest/README.md) file.

## Features

*   An [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) test framework.
*   Test discovery.
*   A rich set of assertions.
*   User-defined assertions.
*   Death tests.
*   Fatal and non-fatal failures.
*   Value-parameterized tests.
*   Type-parameterized tests.
*   Various options for running the tests.
*   XML test report generation.

## Platforms

Google test has been used on a variety of platforms:

*   Linux
*   Mac OS X
*   Windows
*   Cygwin
*   MinGW
*   Windows Mobile
*   Symbian
*   PlatformIO

## Who Is Using Google Test?

In addition to many internal projects at Google, Google Test is also used by the
following notable projects:

*   The [Chromium projects](http://www.chromium.org/) (behind the Chrome browser
    and Chrome OS).
*   The [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler.
*   [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), Google's data
    interchange format.
*   The [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library.
*   [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn): header only,
    dependency-free deep learning framework in C++11.

## Related Open Source Projects

[GTest Runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner) is a Qt5 based
automated test-runner and Graphical User Interface with powerful features for
Windows and Linux platforms.

[Google Test UI](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar) is test runner that
runs your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and
displays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. Google
Test UI is written in C#.

[GTest TAP Listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener) is an event
listener for Google Test that implements the
[TAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) for test
result output. If your test runner understands TAP, you may find it useful.

[gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) is a test runner that
runs tests from your binary in parallel to provide significant speed-up.

[GoogleTest Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter)
is a VS Code extension allowing to view Google Tests in a tree view, and
run/debug your tests.

## Requirements

Google Test is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build and use
with your projects, but there are some. If you notice any problems on your
platform, please notify
[googletestframework@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/googletestframework).
Patches for fixing them are welcome!

### Build Requirements

These are the base requirements to build and use Google Test from a source
package:

*   [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) or [CMake](https://cmake.org/). NOTE: Bazel is
    the build system that googletest is using internally and tests against.
    CMake is community-supported.

*   a C++11-standard-compliant compiler

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
